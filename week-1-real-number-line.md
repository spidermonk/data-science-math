# The Real Number Line
An infinite set - extends to positive infinity and negative infinity - ℝ 
The real numbers
zero, 1, 2, 3, -1, -2, -3, -4, - whole numbers (integers)
ℤ - integers {...-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}
infinite numbers between 1 & 2 (e.g. 1.1, 1.4, 1.153, 1.82523535, ...) and so on

Positive real numbers, anything to the right of zero
Negative real numbers, anything to the left of zero
Non negative real numbers, zero plus positive real numbers
Non positive real numbers, zero plus negative real numbers

10 and -10 have the same distance to 0
7.1 and -7.1 have the same distance to 0

Absolute of a real number X |X| is the distance from X to 0
|10| is 10
|-10| is 10
|7.1| is 7.1
|-7.1| is 7.1

General rule: for any X ∈ ℝ 
|X| = {X 	= if X is non-negative 	}
	  {-X 	= if X is negative 		}
		
Example of a definition by cases (if logic)

# Inequalities
a < b 						a is to the left of b
a > b 						a is to the right of b
a ≤ b 						a is not to the right of b
a ≥ b 						a is not to the left of b
a ≪ b (much less than) 		a is far to the left of b
a ≫ b (much greater than) 	a is far to the right of b

a < b <=> b > a (<=> if and only if)

# Algebra with Inequalities
Algebra with equalities
4 = 4
4+3 = 4+3
Rule - if a = b then a+c = b+c
x+3 = 10, x = 7 (x+3)-3 = 10-3 or x=7
Works for all operators
-5x = 15 -5x / -5 = 15 / -5 or x = -3

Algebra with inequalities
4 < 7 
4+2 < 7+2
4-1 < 7-1
x+3 < 10 (x+3)-3 < 10-3 or x < 7 - half open array or X ∈ (-∞, 7)

Multiplication is trickier
5*3 < 8*3  or 15 < 24
5 * -1 < 8 * -1 or -5 < -8 FALSE, -5 > -8
Rule: a < b, if c > 0 then a . c < b . c; if c < 0 a . c > b . c (flip equality)
Example: -2x < 10 = -2x / -2 > 10 / -2 or x > -5

# Number Intervals and Interval Notation
[2, 3.1] - infinite set with finite bounds - X ∈ ℝ: 2 ≤ X ≤ 3.1 (inclusive or closed interval)

(5, 8) - infinite set with finite bounds - X ∈ ℝ: 5 < X < 8 (exclusive or open interval)

Half open intervals
(-7.1, 15] - infinite set with finite bounds - X ∈ ℝ: -7.1 < X ≤ 15 - left open
[-7.1, 15) - infinite set with finite bounds - X ∈ ℝ: -7.1 ≤ X < 15 - right open

[2, ∞) = X ∈ ℝ: X ≥ 2
(-∞, 2) = X ∈ ℝ: X < 2
