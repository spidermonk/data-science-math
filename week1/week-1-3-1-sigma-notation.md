# Sigma Notation - Summation
∑ - sigma notation 

4
∑ i² - Sum of i=1 to 4 of i squared
i=1
1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30

5
∑ (2i+3) = Sum of i=1 to 5 of (2i + 3)
i=1
5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 = 45

7
∑ j/2 = Sum of j=3 to 7 of j/2
j=3
3/2 + 2 + 5/2 + 3 + 7/2 = 12.5

4
∑ i²
i=1

i=1 is starting range
4 is ending range
i2 is the operation

i & j are dummy indicies - not real variables - symbols for counters

# Rules for Manipulating & Simplifying Sigma Notation

4
∑ 3i² - distributive property means can pull constant out (3)
i=1

OR

4
3 [∑ i²] = 3 * (1 + 4 + 9 + 16) or 3\*30 or 90
i=1

Distributive Property = A(B+C) = AB + AC

4
∑ (i² + 2i) = (1+2) + (4+4) + (9+6) + (16+8) also same as 
i=1

Additive Property - can add numbers in any order so can rewrite as

4		  4
(∑ i²) + (∑ 2i)
i=1		  i=1

10
∑ 5 = 50
k=1
