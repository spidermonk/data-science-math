# Functions

## Mapping from Set to Set
A function f: A -> B is A rule/formula/machine which transforms each a ∈ A into f(a) ∈ B

### Examples:
A = {1, 2, 10}
B = {apple, DE, monkey}

f:A -> B
f(1) = "apple"
f(2) = "apple"
f(10) = "monkey"

### VBS Example
X = {all people in VBS study}
Y = {+, -}

FUnction
test: x -> y
Test(person) = +
Test(person) = -

### Business Example
Y = {..., 2010, 2011, 2012, ...} Years in business and ℝ (real number line)
FUnction: Profit: Y -> ℝ 
Profit(year) = profit/loss in that year

### Supervised Learning
Figure out functions from a sample of input & output because in real-life do not normally have the functions
Given some examples f: A -> B
Given some examples of a ∈ B and f(a) ∈ B -> goal is to figure out function

## Graphing Functions on Cartesian Plane
Example: y=x² or y=2x-1

f: ℝ -> ℝ (function from real number line to real number line)
x -> f(x)
Uses formula insteaed of just matching like above (e.g. 1 = " apple")
f(x) = 2x-1
x=1 f(x)=1
x=0 f(x)=-1
x=5.1 f(x)=9.2

Graph allows visualization of functions with sets in ℝ since all values is infinite

In general if g: ℝ -> ℝ then graph of g is a set of all points in the plane
graph(g) = {(x,y) ∈ ℝ² : y=g(x)}

Graph by testing various inputs through function and plotting points and drawing best fitting line
y = x² - example of a quadratic test

### Vertical line test
Draw a vertical line, if it hits line at 2 points then line cannot be a function - cannot have two answers for any X
Any vertical line intersects the graph of a function only one time

## Increasing & Decreasing Functions
Two classes of functions - not(most) all functions fall into these classes
f is a strictly increasing function if a < b and f(a) < f(b)
f is a strictly decreasing function if a < b and f(a) > f(b)

Example of determining if functions are strictly increasing or strictly decreasing
f(x) = 2ᵡ (example of exponential function) - strictly increasing
g(x) = 3⁻ᵡ - strictly decreasing
h(x) = x² - neither - but if you restrict interval (e.g. 0 to infinity) it can be strictkly increasing or decreasing

### Real-World Examples
Height vs years since birth - neither
Value of car vs years since purchasing car - neither if you consider classics

### Horizontal Line Test
If horizontal line only hits line once then it is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing

## Functions - Composition & Inverse
### Compose 2 functions
f(x) = x²
g(x) = x + 5
Compose f(x) and g(x) g ∘ f: g composed with f or g following f
g ∘ f = x² + 5

Warning:
f ∘ g = (x+5)² - order matters

### Inversion functions
When you compose them it undoes them
f(x) = 2x
g(x) = 1/2x
g ∘ f = (2x)/2 so undoes it
f and g are inverses - g = f⁻¹ (means inverse not to the power of neg 1)

Warning: Not every function has an inverse (most do not)
f(x) = x² - fails horizontal line test so not possible to create an inverse (no way to create square root function that would return 2 and/or -2)
